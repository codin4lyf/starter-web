…one cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e., if history played out in a different way). Such substitute courses of events are called alternative histories.
Clearly, the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome, but such a point seems to be voiced only by people who fail (those who succeed attribute their success to the quality of their decision).

We are blind to alternative histories – those silent events that could have happened but didn’t. In the language of behavioural finance this irrationality is known as Survivorship Bias. T
he outcome which is visible, ‘survived’ and the ones which didn’t survive are hidden.
As Taleb writes –

Imagine an eccentric (and bored) tycoon offering you $10 million to play Russian roulette,
i.e., to put a revolver containing one bullet in the six available chambers to your head and pull the trigger.
Each realization would count as one history, for a total of six possible histories of equal probabilities.
Five out of these six histories would lead to enrichment; one would lead to a statistic, that is, an obituary with an embarrassing (but certainly original) cause of death.
